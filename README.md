# CustomerSegmentation
Leveraging the power of machine learning and the K-means clustering algorithm, this project aims to perform customer segmentation. By analyzing patterns in customer data, such as demographics, purchase history, and behavior, we group customers into distinct segments. 
# Problem Statement
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, identify  segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according  to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each  group effectively.
Use K-means clustering and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then analyze their annual  incomes and spending scores.To make predictions and ﬁnd the clusters of potential customers of the mall and thus ﬁnd appropriate  measures to increase the revenue of the mall is one of the prevailing applications of unsupervised  learning.

For example, a group of customers have high income but their spending score (amount spent in the  mall) is low so from the analysis we can convert such type of customers into potential customers (whose  spending score is high) by using strategies like better advertising, accepting feedback and improving the  quality of products.

To identify such customers, this project analyses and forms clusters based on different criteria which are
discussed in the further sections.
